# Smart-Irrigation-System
Automatic watering system that irrigate soil with water depending on specific water level

Components :
soil moisture : 
FC-28 soil moisture sensor is a soil hygrometric transducer that can read the amount of moisture present in the soil surrounding itIt depends on resistance of soil which increases with increasing of soil dryness

LCD :
This is I2C interface 16x2 LCD display module, a high-quality 2 line 16 character LCD module with on-boardcontrast control adjustment, backlight and I2C communication interface. For Arduino beginners, no more cumbersome 
and complex LCD driver circuit connection. The real significance advantages of this I2C Serial LCD module will simplify the circuit connection, save some I/O pins on Arduino board, simplified firmware development with widely 
available Arduino library.

Relay:
Relay is an electromechanical device that uses an electric current to open or close the contacts of a switch

pump :
to pump the water towards the soil
